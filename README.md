# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
My client, a large company in the tech industry, is looking towards the future as a significant number of their employees begin to approach retirement age. They would like to understand the potential impact of these retirements, in order to plan for the future. There are two areas they are specifically interested in:
1. Who will be retiring in the next few years?
2. Which positions will be coming available?
In order to find answers to these questions, I have used PostgreSQL to analyze the tabular data from the company and create new tables/queries that answer their questions.
